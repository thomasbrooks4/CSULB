Various projects from California State University Long Beach

I have uploaded the following projects to GitHub:


Age of Mythology

  Age of Mythology was a project for my CECS 343 (Software Engineering) course. We were assigned to create a desktop application based on the board game Age of Mythology. Thomas Brooks and Bryan Guerre used C# and Windows Forms in Visual Studio to create a basic construction of this game. The image resources for the game cannot be uploaded to GitHub due to file size, but the code can still be viewed.

Breadth First Traversal

  The Breadth First Traversal project was written in C++ within XCode for my CECS 328 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course. The program uses the breadth first algorithim to traverse a graph entered by the user. After recieving the data and a node to start, it will calculate the distance between the starting node and all of the other nodes using this algorithim.

Edit Distance

  The Edit Distance project was written in C++ within XCode for my CECS 328 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course. The program will take in two different strings and compute the amount of edits it will need to do on the first string to transform it to the second string. This process is used in other programs such as search engines.

Hash Map

  The Hash Map project was written in C# within Xamarin Studio for my CECS 328 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course. The program goes through a given file and allows you to insert a new node, find a particular node, or remove a node from the created hash map.

Heap Memory Manager

  The Heap Memory Manager was written in C within XCode for my CECS 424 (Organization of Programming Languages) course. The program initializes a heap of memory based on a given size and with the use of pointers, allocate/deallocate blocks of memory in the created heap.

JDBC Project

  The JDBC Project was written in SQL and Java within Eclipse for my CECS 323 (Databases) course. The project used a Java program to manipulate a SQL database created on the schools servers.

MVC Game

  The MVC Game project was written in C++ within XCode for my CECS 282 (C++ for Java Programmers) course. This project implemented the commonly used model, view, controller system to create a template used for simple turn based games. The program allows you to play either Othello or Tic Tac Toe and allows the player to make moves, view move history, and undo moves.

Weighted Graph Dijkstra

  The Weighted Graph Dijkstra project was written in C# for my CECS 328 (Data Structures and Algorithims) course. This project traverses through a hard coded weighted graph to get the minimum spanning tree and uses Dijkstra's Algorithim to find the shortest path value to each node in the graph.
